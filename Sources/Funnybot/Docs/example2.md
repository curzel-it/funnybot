Input concept:
```
Episode start off in Andy's living room. Dan, feeling peckish, persuades a reluctant Andy to visit a new eatery recommended by their friend Roy, who works there. Despite Andy's skepticism about Roy's culinary tastes, they drive for three hours to a trucker-frequented fry shop on the outskirts of town.

At the shop, they're greeted by Roy the T-Rex, who serves up bizarre food combinations like anchovy ice cream and pickled banana sandwiches. The food turns out to be as unappetizing as it sounds, causing both Andy and Dan to feel ill. A distressed Andy rushes to the restroom, which is in a deplorable state, and accidentally discovers a portal beneath the shop.

This portal transports Andy to a parallel universe where he finds the "tree of infinite knowledge".
The world seems popupated by alpacas who wear sunglasses and call themselves the Sunglasses Tribe. They welcome Andy and reveal their intent to invade Earth for its resources and novelties, like sweets and sunglasses, since they lack opposable thumbs to create their own. The alpacas are irked when Andy mistakenly refers to them as "lamas," a cultural faux pas that leads to his expulsion from their world.

Meanwhile, back in the original world, Dan and Roy have left the fry shop and are settling their stomachs with coffee at a diner. Unbeknownst to them, the coffee is abysmal, offending the ape wait staff, leading to a chaotic escape from an impending ape attack.

Back in the alpaca universe, after Andy has used their otherworldly bathroom, the alpacas decide theyâ€™ve had enough of him, and Andy is unceremoniously sent back through the portal, landing back at the fry shop.

Dan and Roy manage to get back inside the fry shop to hide from the apes, but they get caught there.

Andy, Dan, and Roy lie defeated on the floor of the fry shop, only to be found by Bella, who is miffed at being left out of their shenanigans. Andy and Dan recount their wild experiences, with Andy mentioning "talking llamas" and Dan exasperatedly blurting out about "fucking monkeys."

In the final moments, the alpacas from the parallel universe appear to have followed Andy through the portal, signifying that the crossover between the two worlds may have just begun.
