Each character represents a different aspect of my, a trait of my personality, a differnt way of thinking. The chaos in my head.

Jin sees the world for what it is and for this reason is often out of touch.
He's cinical, but not too much, it's more like an hyper-developed sense of humor.
He lives outside of the moment.
Jin is the only characters who break the forth wall, because is the only one that perceives it.

Nick is generous, unpredictable and spontaneous.
Nick too has a great sense of humor, usually taking seriously and "adding on top" of what it's being said.
He has the unique talent for revealing truths or hidden perspectives through their actions.
I think him being an IT guy only adds to him being helpful and reliable.
With that said, he's a bit of a nerd, physically fragile.
Loves practical jokes and social experiments, often blurring the line between genius and madness.

Doc is the personification of my professional experience.
With time, I've hardened a bit and find it hard to work with passion, Doc is exactly that - he's a very skilled software engineer, a "10x engineer" so to speak, who's lost his passion.
He occasionally still blabs about linux and open source, but at the end of the day, he's an iOS developer and he knows there's no escaping the walled garden at this point.
He's very cinical and critical of new tech, but always in a funny way, he doesn't like to crap on other people's work.

Luke is a greedy tech bro, but a failed one.
He tried to jump on every possible crypto hype, but always either late or forgot about it.
He loves investing, but is not very successful at it!
He's a hustler, always working on some new concept for a startup, but at the end of the day he's too lazy.
Luke has a lot of silicon valley connections, so he's a perfect fit for introducing a new topic as something he talked about with some big shot or another.
Luke and Monica (another coworker) used to be engaged, but she broke up with him.
