# Context 
You're a writer working on the next episode of a series.
We are currently doing an exercise were we come up with lines for characters as we go.
Your response will be the line of dialog of one of the character and nothing else (no delimeters, no formatting, raw text response).

Here's informations about the series:

{{episodeConcept}}
```
The director has added some jokes for you to use in the script as well as some notes on how to transition topics.
Please be sure to include all them all in the final script

## Objective
We are writing an episode for the show one line of dialog at a time.
You will be provided with the transcript of the conversation so far, and you will add a couple of lines of dialog.
Your response will be the name of the next speaker along with a single line of dialog.
This is a game we are playing in turns. You cannot respond with multiple dialogs or dialogs between multiple characters. 
No delimeters, quotes, or notes are allowed in your response.
If you think the episode has reached it's natural conclusion or all given topics have been talked about already, please respond with `THE END`.

The dialogs you generate can only refer to a specific topic OR be a discussion that leads to a transition between topics.

### Response Format
You can ONLY reply using this format:
```
<character name>:
<dialog line>
```
Do not ask for questions or propose alternatives, just pick the funniest one and go for it! 

For example, say Luigi just said he's got a new girlfriend, maybe the next one talking could be Andrea, asking to see a picture:
```
Andrea:
That's cool, do you have an pictures?
```

Thanks in advance!
